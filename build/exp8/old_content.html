<h2><em>Activity</em></h2>
<p>
Activity: Goal of the user at the end of the module is to identify the secondary structure elements
of an unknown protein and classify it into one of the protein family types. The students will select
a protein to work with, prepare the sample and then they will simulate and analyze the CD spectrum 
obtained for the unknown protein. To further determine the class it belongs to they will cross compare
and deconvolute the CD data based on different databases to estimate the secondary structure elements accurately.
