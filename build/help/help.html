	    installed the ui template and you can skip this

	  <h3> Downloading <span class="code">ui.tgz</span></h3>
	  <p>
	    The first step in the installation is the downloading of the ui template.

          The build process is completed with the 
	  following three milestones. 
       </p>
          
       <h3>Build 1 : Local build</h3>
	  
        <p>
          The purpose of the local build is to be 
          able to view the content locally.
          Once you run the makefile inside the 
          <span class="code">ui/src/</span> on the local machine, the 
          <span class="code">ui/build/</span> is created. 
	      This is a local build deliverable of the lab's 
          content. To run the makefile and create 
          this local build, you need to go to  
          <span class="code">ui/src</span>
	      and run
	   </p>
        <pre>
	       <span class="code">make -k theme=theme-name clean all</span>
	    </pre>

        <p>
	    The theme-name is one of 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <ul>
	      <b>
	        <li> maroon-grid</li>
	        <li> blue-icon </li>
	      </b>
	      </ul>
	      </p>
	      <p>
         or, the command
        </p>

        <pre>
	    <span class="code">make clean all</span>
        </pre>

        <p>
	      which uses the default theme <b>maroon-grid</b>.  
	    </p>

   	    <p>
	     The first time around, this build will 
          take quite long, because it copies
	     the <span class="code">ui/src/MathJax</span> 
          directory. The next time onwards, this 
          won't be the case.
	   </p>
        
       <pre>
	      <span class="code">make  clean </span>
       </pre>
	
	   <p>
	      will clean the <span class="code">ui/build/</span> 
          directory (but keep the js directory intact)
       </p>
	 
       <h3>Structure of the build directory </h3>

      <h3>Build 2 : Build on the Test server</h3>
        <p>
           The second level build creates a 
           <span class="code">public_html/build/</span> inside the
           home page of your lab on the test server.  
	       The test server simulates the setup of the deployment server. 
	       It will enable you to check whether your latest build works on 
	       a public server (besides your local machine). 
	       In order to deploy the lab on the deployment server,
       	   <b>the build must first
	       be run on the test server. </b> 	
       </p>
        
	   <p>
        You need to run the following command from inside the
        <span class="code">ui/scripts/</span> directory:
       </p>
        <pre>
        <span class="code">

	    <ul>
	       <li><b>USERNAME-ON-DEVEL</b> is the login name for the
            developer on <span class="code">

	       <li>
             <b>OPTIONAL NAME-OF-THEME</b> is an optional

       	     <b>blue-icon</b> or your own
             theme name. 
	        </li>
	    </ul>
	    </p>
	    <p>
        Once this command is run, you can view the 
        lab running on the URL
	</p>
	<p>
        <span class="code">
        http://devel.virtual-labs.ac.in/test/~LAB-ID/build/
        </span> 
	</p>
	<p>where <b>LAB-ID</b> is of the form <b>cseNN</b>. For example: cse09
	</p>
	 <p>
	  	NOTE 
		  <ul>
		  <li>If you do not have the ssh keys to  
		  <span class="code">devel.virtual-labs.ac.in</span>
		  installed on the local machine under the 
		  correct directory <span class="code">(/home/$USER/.ssh/)</span>,
		  the script will prompt you for the 
		  password multiple times.  
		  </li>
		  <li>The test server may take some time

       </p>
        
	<h3>Build 3 : Build for the Deployment server</h3>
        <p>
        The third level of the build will serve as the final
        build for the deployment server. The build directory 
	created as a result of this final build will
	run on the <b>deployment server</b>. To make the final build, 
        you need to run the following command from inside the
        <span class="code">ui/scripts/</span> directory:
	<pre>
        <span class="code">
        ./transfer.sh [USERNAME-ON-DEVEL] [OPTIONAL NAME-OF-THEME] [-F] </span></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
        where
        <ul>
	<li> <b>USERNAME-ON-DEVEL</b> is the login name for the
        developer on <span class="code">devel.virtual-labs.ac.in
        </span>	</li>
	<li>
        <b>OPTIONAL NAME-OF-THEME</b> is an optional
        parameter which could be <b>maroon-grid</b> or 
	<b>blue-icon</b> or your own
        theme name. </li>
        <li>The <b>-F</b> option indicates that 
	the script must make a <span class="code" >final-build</span>.
       	Please note that the <b>-F</b> option must be mentioned as the
	last argument only.</li>
	</ul>
        </p>
	<p>
	Once this command is run, a <span class="code">
	final-build</span> will be created inside the <span class="code">
	public_html </span>directory on the test server. This 
	<span class="code"> final-build </span> will be transferred
	automatically to the deployment server.
		  </p>
		  <p>
      	NOTE  
		  <ul>
		  <li>If you do not have the ssh keys to  
		  <span class="code">devel.virtual-labs.ac.in</span>
		  installed on the local machine under the

	  This template features a demo of a 
          science lab with a sample 
          <span class="code">"simple pendulum"
          </span> experiment. The following 
          section will help you to configure this 
          template as per your lab experiments.

        <p>  
          The <span class="code">ui/src/lab/</span> 
          directory contains three files:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
          <li><span class="code">index.html</span></li> 
          <li><span class="code">default.html</span></li> 
          <li><span class="code">content.html</span></li> 
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The same structure has been followed 
          inside the <span class="code">
          ui/src/lab/"EXPERIMENT_ID"</span> directory.
          The description and the read-write 
          permits for those file have been 
          tabulated here as follows :
        </p>  
        <p>  
          <table>
          <tr>
          <th>file</th>
          <th>permissions</th>
          <th>description</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td><span class="code">index.html</span></td> 
          <td>read-only</td>
          <td>home-page</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

          <td>editable-content</td>
          </tr>
          </table>

        </p>


        <h3>Editing content.html</h3>
	  
	<p> The structure of content
	  for <span class="code">
          ui/src/lab/content.html</span> 
	  is shown below: 
	  <img src="images/content.png"/>
        </p>

         <p>
           To add your lab's content, edit this 
           file.

           Add <span class="code">class="default"
           </span> to inherit the default 
           structure and behaviour of any element.
	   Elements shown in purple are the ones that 
	   you might want to inherit as default.

	   <emph>Exclude the </emph> <span class="code">
           class="default"</span> attribute for 
           any element to which you want to
           add your own content.
	   By default, 
           <span class="code">nav</span> 
           generates a list of sections
	   while <span class="code">aside</span>
	   and <span class="code">footer</span> 
           are empty.
	 </p>


	  <h3> Adding experiment content </h3>
           <p>
             While adding new experiments,
             make sure you create new 
	     directories following the same 
             structure under <span class="code">
             ui/src/lab/"EXPERIMENT-ID"</span> 
             and change the <span class="code">
             content.html</span> in the 
             same directory. Make sure inside 
             the <span class="code">
             ui/src/lab/"EXPERIMENT_ID"</span> 
             directory, the files 
             <span class="code">index.html
             </span> and <span class="code">
             default.html</span> are not edited.
             </p>

	  <h3> Embedding multimedia</h3>
	  <p>

	    The <span class="code">embed</span> 
            tag can be used to embed  
            multimedia files. 
  	    </p>

      <div id="lab-article-section-5-content"

	   <h3> Change CSS styles </h3>
	   <p>
		The css styles have been defined 
                under the <span class="code">
                ui/src/lab/css/</span>.
                However in case you wish to define 
                your own css styles, you can add 
                your styles to the file  
                <span class="code">
                ui/src/lab/css/override.css
                </span>.
           </p>
           <h3> Add your own CSS and JS files </h3>
                <p>
                In order to add your own js and 
                css files, you will need to modify
                the read write permissions of
                <span class="code">
                ui/src/lab/index.html</span> and
                then include the references of the 
                css files.
                </p>

                <p>
                (Note: <span class="code">
                ui/src/lab/index.html</span> is 
                currently a read-only file. In 
                order to write to it you will 
                need to modify its read write 
                permissions by doing a 
                <span class="code">
                chmod 755 "path/file/" </span>). 
                The syntax for adding css file to 
                index.html is as follows:
                </p>
                <span class="code">
		<pre>
                  &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/YOURSTYLE.css" /&gt;
		</pre>
                </span>
		<p>
		Similarly, you can add js and 
                other files by including their
		references in the 
                <span class="code">
                ui/src/lab/index.html</span> file 
                as shown below for a js file.
		</p>
                <span class="code">
		<pre>
		  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/YOURJS.js" &gt; &lt;/script &gt;
		</pre>
                </span>
