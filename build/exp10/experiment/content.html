	<h2>Objective</h2>
	<p>The purpose of the lab is to understand the effect of chiral substance on a plane polarised
	 light as a function of wave length. 
	 </p>
	
<p>
By doing this experiment the user will be able to understand that:</p>
</p><br>(1) A plane polarised light is made up of one Right Circularly and one Left Circularly polarised light. 
</p>
<p>
(2) Different Refractive Indexes for different circularly polarised components of an anisotropic medium give 
rise to Optical Rotation.
 </p>
 <p>(3) Different rate of absorption for different circularly polarised components of an anisotropic medium

	<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>
We have already learned from Experiment 1, how chiral molecules are optically active and how chiral substances 
can be characterized on the basis of their specific rotation [&alpha;]. You will have noticed that in that experiment
we have used a sodium lamp with a wavelength of 589 nm as the light source, and may be wondering why the wave length
of light source needed to be specified. 
</p>


<p>
Well, as has been explained in the following video using sucrose solution as an example, the specific rotation
[&alpha;] for a given substance, and hence the molar rotation [&phi;], varies as a function of the wavelength (&lambda;)
 of the light source.This variation in the optical rotation ([&alpha;] or [&phi;] ) of a substance, with the variation in
  the wavelength (&lambda;) of light, is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_rotatory_dispersion" target="_blank">optical 
rotatory dispersion (ORD)</a>.

When a plane polarised wave passes through an optically active medium some times its<em> state of polarisation</em> 
also gets affected along with its <em>plane of polarisation</em> and it comes out from the medium as an elliptically
polarised light. This phenomena is known as <em>Circular Dichroism</em>.

<h1>Theory</h1><br><br>
<h2>Recap of Experiment 1</h2>

<p>In <a href="http://pascal.iiit.ac.in/ccnsb/cd/exp1/" target="_blank">experiment:1</a> we have talked
 about the phenomenon of<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves)" target="_blank")
  > polarisation </a>of electromagnetic waves. We have tried to emphasize on two aspects of a plane polarised
   or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_polarization" target="_blank">linearly polarised</a> wave.</p>
<ol>
<li>
A plane polarised wave is a composition of a left and a right  
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_polarization" target="_blank">circularly polarised waves</a> propagating in phase.
It is visually described  by the following animation. Here the green and the red curve shows
propagation of  right and left circularly polarised wave respectively. And superposition of them
is the blue curve which is a plane polarised wave.

<li>Whenever a electromagnetic wave enters a medium its velocity gets reduced. The ratio of its velocity in vacuum to its velocity in the medium is known as 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index" target="_blank">refractive index</a> and is represented by, n = c<sub>0 </sub>/ v where c<sub>0</sub> is the velocity of the wave in vacuum
  and v is the velocity of the wave in the medium</li>
  </ol>
<br>

<p>
<h2>Anisotropic Medium And Speed of Light</h2><br>
In an isotropic medium the properties of the medium are the same in all directions.
 But in an anisotropic medium the properties become directionally dependent. 
 Anisotropic materials may have different indices of refraction associated with
 different crystallographic directions. A common situation is that, there are
 two distinct indices of refraction, and they are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence" target="_blank">birefringent</a>
 materials. In case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_activity" target="_blank">optically active</a> chilral molecules, 
 they have different refractive indices for different circularly polarised components of a plane polarised wave(n<sub>L</sub> &#8800 n<sub>R</sub>).
 That means, once the plane polarised wave enters the medium speed of its right circular part and left circular part will
 be different(c<sub>L</sub> &#8800 c<sub>R</sub>). This property is known as circular birefringence.  
 </p>
 
<p>
These two aspects together give rise to the phenomena called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_rotation" target="_blank">Optical
 Rotation</a>, rotation of plane of polarisation 
of a plane polarised wave after it passes through an optically active medium.
</p> 
<p>
In <a href="http://pascal.iiit.ac.in/ccnsb/cd/exp1/" target="_blank">experiment 1</a> we have seen and the Optical
Rotation of a light wave (which is an example of EM wave) when it passes through an optically
active medium like sugar solution. There we have measured the specific rotation [α]<sup>T</sup><sub>λ </sub>of the 
light wave for different concentrations of  medium at a  fixed wave length of incident light λ~589nm(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-line#Atomic_Spectral_Lines" target="_blank">Na D-line</a>)and fixed temperature T. In the this experiment we are going to observe how the specific rotation changes with wave length of incident light.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Dependence of specific rotation on the wavelength: Optical Rotatory Dispersion </h2><br>
<p>
A wave can be characterized by its amplitude and phase. Amplitude of a wave is the maximum
displacement of the particles of the medium from its equilibrium position. Whereas phase
of a wave is the definition of a point in a waveform. Interaction of the wave with a material
effects its velocity and magnitude and this may in turn cause a change in these two characters.
If the material is transparent then no change takes place in phase. But in the case of an 
anisotropic medium there may be difference in velocity of different components of the wave 
(which causes change in phase). If the medium has absorptive property, then change in amplitude may take place.
</p>
<p>
The electric vector of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_wave" target="_blank">EM wave</a>
is always perpendicular to
the direction of its propagation. For a plane polarised wave the electric vector of its Left circular
part (<b>E</b><sub><b>L</b></sub>) and the electric vector of its Right circular part (<b>E</b><sub><b>R</b></sub>) make equal angles with the plane of
polarization (α<sub>L</sub> and α<sub>R</sub>) ie they are in phase. As we have discussed, after entering an optically active
medium velocities of the two components of a plane polarised wave (v<sub>L</sub> and v<sub>R</sub>) differs from each other. 
As a result the angles that <b>E</b><sub><b>L</b></sub> and <b>E</b><sub><b>R</b></sub> make with the initial plane of polarisation, no longer remains the 
same i.e. α<sub>L</sub> &#8800 α<sub>R</sub>. 
This will give rise to a phase shift  between the two components of a plane polarised wave
,δ = α<sub>L</sub> – α<sub>R</sub> .
<br>
<p>
The following figure describes this.
</p>
<table>
<tr>

<img src="fig1.jpg" height="300" width="200"></center>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
But the superposition of these two oppositely circularly polarised wave will still
generate a plane polarised wave with its plane of polarisation rotated to an angle
α',as described by the following figure.From the concepts of geometry it may be shown that the angle of rotation α' is half of the phase shift δ.<sup><strong>[*]</strong></sup>
</p>

</td>

</table>
<p>
Now we will see how this angle of rotation depends on the wave length λ of the incident light.
To understand the dependence let us first write down the electric vectors of a right circularly
polarised and a left circularly polarised wave propagating in the same direction (z) as follows
</p>
<br>
<p><b>
E<sub>R</sub>(z)= E<sub>o</sub>/2  cos&omega;(t - z/V<sub>R</sub>)<br>
E<sub>L</sub>(z)= E<sub>o</sub>/2  cos&omega;(t - z/V<sub>L</sub>)
</b></p><br>
<p>Here, E<sub>o</sub> = the magnitude<br>
                  &omega; = angular frequency<br>
                  z = distance traveled<br>
                  v = velocity in the medium of the wave<br>
</p>
<br>
</p>
<p>
At any instant, the resultant of <b>E</b><sub><b>R</b></sub> and <b>E</b><sub><b>L</b> </sub>(i.e. <b>E</b><sub><b>R</b></sub> + <b>E</b><sub><b>L</b></sub>) will produce a
 plane polarised wave. We will see how much phase shift is generated when
a wave travels a distance, say d, through an optically active medium.
 For that we can look at the equations of waves at z = 0 and at z = d.
</p>
<br>


<p>
<b>
E<sub>R</sub>(o)= E<sub>o</sub>/2 cos&omega; t<br>
E<sub>L</sub>(o)= E<sub>o</sub>/2 cos&omega; t
</b>
</p>

<br>
<p>
<b>
E<sub>R</sub>(d)= E<sub>o</sub>/2  cos&omega;(t - d/V<sub>R</sub>)<br>
E<sub>L</sub>(d)= E<sub>o</sub>/2  cos&omega;(t - d/V<sub>L</sub>)
</b>
</p><br>




<p>
Applying trigonometric laws we 
can show that the phase difference
between <b>E</b><sub><b>R</b></sub>(0)+<b>E</b><sub><b>L</b>(</sub>0) and <b>E</b><sub><b>R</b></sub>(d)+<b>E</b><sub><b>L</b></sub>(d) is given by  
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>
&delta;=&omega; .d (1/V<sub>R</sub> - 1/V<sub>L</sub>)=&omega; .d/c (n<sub>L</sub> - n<sub>R</sub>)
</b>
</p>
<br>


<p>
Now as we know, velocity of any EM wave in any medium = (wave length of wave in the mediun)
X (frequency in that medium) and angular frequency = 2πX frequency of wave. So,
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>
&delta;=2&pi;/&lambda;(n<sub>L</sub> - n<sub>R</sub>)d
</b>
</p>
<br>




<p>
But &alpha;'= &delta; /2. So we can have angle of rotation directly as a function of wave length as,
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>
&alpha; '= &delta;/2= &pi;/&lambda;(n<sub>L</sub> - n<sub>R</sub>)d
</b>
</p>
<br>




<p>
So with change in the wavelength of  a light, its optical rotation will also change for the same medium. This phenomena
 is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_rotatory_dispersion" target=_"blank"><strong>Optical Rotatory Dispersion</strong></a>.
</p>
<p>
In practical purpose, to study ORD one usually looks at two 
parameters – <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_rotation" target="_blank">specific rotation</a> [α]<sup>T</sup><sub>λ</sub> and molecular rotation [M]<sup>T</sup><sub>λ</sub>. They are defined as follows.

A plot of [α]<sup>T</sup><sub>λ</sub> or [M]<sup>T</sup><sub>λ</sub>with wavelength λ is known as ORD spectra. From an ORD
spectra of an unknown material we can have an understanding of the optical properties of the material.</p>

<h2>Absorption and Extinction Coefficient- A Recap</h2><br>
When an EM wave passes through a medium, the energy of its photon may be taken up by the electrons of the atoms 
of the medium. This is called<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)" target="_blank"> absorption</a></h>. 
As a result the wave loses its energy and its amplitude gets reduced. This is called attenuation of a wave.
Absorption may occur for any type of polarised wave. The following figures exhibit how a linearly polarised 
wave and a circularly polarised wave are attenuated by an absorptive medium.

<br>
<p>
The ratio of radiant power transmitted (P) by a sample to the radiant power incident (P<sub>0</sub>) on the sample is called the transmittance, T: 
T = P/P<sub>0</sub>
</p>
<p>
Absorbance (A), then, is defined as the logarithm (base 10) of the reciprocal of the transmittance:<br> 
<b>A = -log T = log (1/T) </b>
</p>

<br>
<p>
In a spectrophotometer, monochromatic plane-parallel light enters a sample at right angles to the plane-surface
of the sample. In these conditions, the transmittance and absorbance of a sample depends on the molar concentration
(c), light path length in centimetres (L), and molar absorptivity (ε) for the dissolved substance at the specified 
wavelength (λ).  
<br>
<b>T<sub>λ</sub> = 10<sup>εcL</sup> or A<sub>λ</sub> = εcL</b> 
</p>

<br>

<p>
Beer’s Law states that molar absorptivity is constant (and the absorbance is proportional to concentration) 
for a given substance dissolved in a given solute and measured at a given wavelength.
</p>
<br>
<p>
For this reason, molar absorptivities are called molar absorption coefficients or molar extinction coefficients.
Because transmittance and absorbance are unitless, the units for molar absorptivity must cancel with units of measure
in concentration and light path. Therefore, molar absorptivities have units of M<sup>-1</sup>cm<sup>-1</sup>.
</p>
<br>


<p>
<h2>Circular Dichroism – The transformation of plane polarized light into elliptically polarized light</h2><br>
Some asymmetric (chiral) materials possess a special property that they absorb left circularly polarized light (LCPL) to 
a different extent than right circularly polarized light(RCPL). Such materials are said to be exhibiting the phenomenon
of Circular Dichroism or CD (The word 'dichroism' means that the material absorbs two different types of light differently).
</p>
<br>
<p>
Following Beer's law if absorbance of LCPL A<sub>L</sub> is different from absorbance of RCPL A<sub>R</sub> then,<br>


<b>A<sub>R</sub> &ne;A<sub>L</sub><br>
i.e. ε<sub>R</sub>cL &ne;ε<sub>L</sub>cL<br>
i.e. ε<sub>R</sub> &ne; ε<sub>L</sub>
</b>
</p>

<br>
<p>
We can study the effects of circular dichroism as a difference between molar extinction coefficients
(∆ε = ε<sub>R</sub> - ε<sub>L</sub>) of LCPL and RCPL.
</p>
<br>

<p>
Now let us discuss the results of circular dichroism on a plane polarised light. So if a plane polarised 
light enters a a circular dichroic substance its two circular components undergo through separate absorptive
effect of the medium. So the resultant wave will no longer be a linearly polarized wave i.e. the resulting field
vector does not oscillate along a straight line but it rotates along an ellipsoid path. Such a light wave is called
an elliptically polarized light. The direction of rotation of the elliptically polarized light (or, more exactly, its
field vector) is determined by the circular component that remains stronger after traversing the material
</p>
<br>

<p>
As is evident from the figure above, one of the axis of the ellipse is parallel to the polarization plane 
of the original light wave and another is orthogonal to it. This is the case when the material doesn't show
any refraction. However, there may be a difference between the refractive indices of the material for the RCPL
and LCPL as well. Then the axis of of the elliptically polarised resultant wave undergoes a rotion and no longer
remains parallel to the plane of polarisation of the original wave any more. The material is said to posses both 
Circular Birefringence and Circular Dichroism.
</p>

<p>
As we have measured ORD by specific rotation, in this case we also use parameters like delta absorbance, 
molar circular dichroism, molar ellipticity, molar residue ellipticity etc to measure the CD. Here are definition,
description and the inter relation of these parameters.
</p>
<br><h2>Goal of The Experiment</h2><br>
<p>This experiment has two parts. The first part elaborates the effect of an anisotropic medium on the velocity of light passing through it. It shows how the plane of polarisation of a plane polarised light changes when RI of its two circularly polarised components are different from each other. It also describes the dispersive phenomena of optical rotation caused by the medium.
</p>
<p>The second part of the experiment demonestrates the effect of an anisotropic medium on the amplitude of the wave passing through it. It exhibits how state of polarisation of a plane polarised wave changes when rate of absorbance of its two circularly polarised components are different.
