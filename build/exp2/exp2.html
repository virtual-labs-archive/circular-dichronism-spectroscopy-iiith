<h2>Recap of Experiment 1</h2>

<p>In experiment 1 (<a href="http://pascal.iiit.ac.in/ccnsb/cd/exp1/" target="_blank">http://pascal.iiit.ac.in/ccnsb/cd/exp1/</a>) we have talked
 about the phenomenon of polarisation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(waves))
  of electromagnetic waves. We have tried to emphasize on two aspects of a plane polarised
   or linearly polarised (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_polarization" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_polarization</a>) wave.</p>

<li>
A plane polarised wave is a composition of a left and a right circularly polarised waves 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_polarization) propagating in phase.
It is visually described  by the following animation. Here the green and the red curve shows
propagation of  right and left circularly polarised wave respectively. And superposition of them
is the blue curve which is a plane polarised wave.

<li>Whenever a electromagnetic wave enters a medium its velocity gets decreased. The ratio of its velocity in vacuum to its velocity in the medium is known as refractive index
 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index</a>) and is represented by,n = c<sub>0 </sub>/ c where c<sub>0</sub> is the velocity of the wave in vacuum
  and c is the velocity of the wave in the medium</li>
  </ol>
<br>

<p>
In an isotropic medium the properties of the medium are the same in all directions.
 But in an anisotropic medium the properties become directionally dependent. 
 Anisotropic materials may have different indices of refraction associated with
 different crystallographic directions. A common situation with is that, there are
 two distinct indices of refraction, and they are called birefringent ((<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birefringence</a>))
 materials. In case of optically active (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_activity" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_activity</a>) chilral molecules, 
 they have different refractive indices for different circularly polarised components of a plane polarised wave(n<sub>L</sub> not equal to n<sub>R</sub>).
 That means, once the plane polarised wave enters the medium speed of its right circular part and left circular part will
 be different(c<sub>L</sub> not equal to c<sub>R</sub>). This property is known as circular birefringence.  
 </p>
 
<p>
These two aspects together give rise to the phenomena called Optical
 Rotation(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_rotation" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_rotation</a>), rotation of plane of polarisation 
of a plane polarised light after it passes through an optically active medium.
</p> 
<p>
In experiment 1 (<a href="http://pascal.iiit.ac.in/ccnsb/cd/exp1/" target="_blank">http://pascal.iiit.ac.in/ccnsb/cd/exp1/</a>) we have seen and the Optical
Rotation of a light wave (which is an example of EM wave) when it passes through an optically
active medium like sugar solution. There we have measured the specific rotation [α]<sup>T</sup><sub>λ </sub>of the 
light wave for different concentrations of  medium at a  fixed wave length of incident light λ~589nm(Na D-line(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-line#Atomic_Spectral_Lines" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-line#Atomic_Spectral_Lines</a>)) and fixed temperature T. In the this experiment we are going to observe how the specific rotation changes with wave length of incident light.
</p>
<br>
<strong>Dependence of specific rotation on the wavelength: Optical Rotatory Dispersion </strong>
<p>
A wave can be characterized by its amplitude and phase. Amplitude of a wave is the maximum
displacement of the particles of the medium from its equilibrium position. Whereas phase
of a wave is the definition of a point in a waveform. Interaction of the wave with a material
effects its velocity and magnitude and this may in turn cause a change in these two characters.
If the material is transparent then no change takes place in phase. But in the case of an 
anisotropic medium there may be difference in velocity of different components of the wave 
(which causes change in phase). If the medium has absorptive property, then change in amplitude may take place.
</p>
<p>
The electric vector of a EM wave (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_wave" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_wave</a>) 
is always perpendicular to
the direction of its propagation. For a plane polarised wave the electric vector of its Left circular
part (EL) and the electric vector of its Right circular part (ER) make equal angles with the plane of
polarization (α<sub>L</sub> and α<sub>R</sub>) ie they are in phase. As we have discussed, after entering an optically active
medium velocities of the two components of a plane polarised wave (vL and vR) differs from each other. 
As a result the angles that EL and ER make with the initial plane of polarisation, no longer remains the 
same i.e. α<sub>L</sub> not equal to α<sub>R</sub>. 
This will give rise to a phase shift  between the two components of a plane polarised wave
,δ = α<sub>L</sub> – α<sub>R</sub> .
</p>
<img src="fig1.gif">
<p>
But the superposition of these two oppositely circularly polarised wave will still
generate a plane polarised wave with its plane of polarisation rotated to an angle
α'.From the concepts of geometry it may be shown that the angle of rotation α' is half of the phase shift δ.<sup>[a]</sup>
</p>
<img src="fig2_2.gif">

<p>
Now we will see how this angle of rotation depends on the wave length λ of the incident light.
To understand the dependence let us first write down the electric vectors of a right circularly
polarised and a left circularly polarised wave propagating in the same direction (z) as follows
</p>
<p>
<img src="eq1.gif"><br>Here, E0 = the magnitude<br>
                  ω = angular frequency<br>
                  z = distance traveled<br>
                  v = velocity in the medium of the wave<br>

</p>
<p>
At any instant, the resultant of ER and EL (ie E<sub>R</sub> + E<sub>L</sub>) will produce a
 plane polarised wave. We will see how much phase shift is generated when
a wave travels a distance, say d, through an optically active medium.
 For that we can look at the equations of waves at z = 0 and at z = d.
</p>
<img src="eq2.gif">
<img src="eq3.gif">
<br>
<p>
Applying trigonometric laws[b] we 
can show that the phase difference
between E<sub>R</sub>(0)+E<sub>L(</sub>0) and E<sub>R(</sub>0)+E<sub>L</sub>(0) is given by  
</p>
<img src="eq4.gif">
<p>
Now as we know, velocity of any EM wave in any medium = (wave length of wave in the mediun)
X (frequency in that medium) and angular frequency = 2πX frequency of wave. So,
</p>
<img src="eq5.gif">
<br>

<p>
But α'= δ/2. So we can have angle of rotation directly as a function of wave length as,
</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>
So with change in the wavelength of  a light, its optical rotation will also change for the same medium. This phenomena
 is known as <strong>Optical Rotatory Dispersion</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_rotatory_dispersion" target=_"blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_rotatory_dispersion</a>).
</p>
<p>
In practical purpose, to study ORD one usually looks at two 
parameters – specific rotation [α]<sup>T</sup><sub>λ</sub> and molecular rotation [M]<sup>T</sup><sub>λ</sub>. They are defined as follows.

<p>
spectra of an unknown material we can have an understanding of the optical properties of the material.</p>
<br>
<p>
Now let us see properties of some ORD spectra.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Plain ORD curve</strong>
These curves are observed for transparent compounds in the UV range.
A plain curve results showing a steady increase (or decrease) of optical
rotation with decrease in wavelength. These curves does not cross the
zero-rotation axis and are devoid of maxima or minima within measurable 
range. So-called plain curve is the ORD for a chiral compound that lacks a chromophore.
For Example, alcohols and hydrocarbons exhibit such kind of ORD curves.

<p>
<strong>Another Property, Absorbance : Anomalous ORD Curve</strong>
</p>
<p>
We have mentioned the term chromophore. It is the part of a molecule 
where absorbance of light takes place. This occurs because at this part 
energy of electronic transition between two molecular orbitals matches
with energy of the photons of the incident light. Incident light that 
hits the chromophore can thus be absorbed by exciting an electron from its 
ground state into an excited state. So there is a range of wavelength where
called the absorption band where the light is absorved. This absorption band
has a maxima at a particular wavelength λmax. As a result there comes an anomaly
in the ORD curve at the neighborhood of the chromophore. The absolute magnitude 
of the optical rotation at first varies rapidly with wavelength, crosses zero at 
absorption maxima and then again varies rapidly with wavelength but in opposite direction. 
Such anomaly is known as Cotton effect (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_effect" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_effect</a>). 
As opposed to plain curves, these curves exhibit a number of extreme peaks and troughs 
depending on the number of absorbing groups. The Cotton effect is called positive if the
optical rotation first increases as the wavelength decreases (as first observed by Cotton), 
and negative if the rotation first decreases. The following figure exhibits both types of Cotton effects.

This experiment has got two parts. In the first
part (experiment 2a) we will examine how the specific rotation
changes with wavelength by actually handling example EM wave 
functions using a programme called emanim_ord.py . And in the second part
(experiment 2b) we will try to determine the ORD spectra of some sample compounds
exhibiting plain as well as anomalous ORD spectra
