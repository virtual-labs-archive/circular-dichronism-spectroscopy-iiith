In Experiment 2 we have seen how an electro magnetic wave interacts with an anisotropic medium.
We have observed the phenomena called Optical Rotatory Dispersion where the optical rotation of
a plane polarised light is studied as a function of wave length of the incident light. Now we will
try to understand how the ORD spectra can be used to study the structure of an optically active substance. 
We will study different types of normal and abnormal ORD spectra and try to correlate them with structural
properties of the chiral molecule.

In the previous experiment we have seen that optical rotation of a plane polarised light changes with the wave length of the light when it passes through an anisptropic medium. We measure this change in optical rotation per unit length of the medium as specific rotation. In ORD spectroscopy we change the wavelength of the incident light and measure the change in specific rotation of the light. So an ORD spectrum will give us a plot of specific rotation (some times molar specific rotation) against wavelength. Depending on the nature of the chiral center different anisotropic medium produces different ORD spectrum. Hence ORD spectra may be used as a very efficient tool to determine the nature of chirality in an anisotropic medium.
<br/><br/> </p>

<p></p><h2>ORD spectra</h2><p></p>

<br/><p>
Now let us see how different types of ORD spectra represents different physical properties of a medium.
</p><br/>
<p>
<strong>Dispersion and Plain ORD Curve</strong><br/>
These curves are observed for transparent compounds in the UV range.A plain curve results showing a steady increase (or decrease) of optical rotation with decrease in wavelength. These curves does not cross the zero-rotation axis and are devoid of maxima or minima within measurable range. So-called plain curve is the ORD for a chiral compound that lacks a chromophore. For Example, alcohols and hydrocarbons exhibit such kind of ORD curves.

<p>
<strong>Another Property, Absorbance : Anomalous ORD Curve</strong>
</p>
<p>
We have mentioned the term chromophore. It is the part of a molecule where absorbance of light takes place. This occurs because at this part 
energy of electronic transition between two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_orbital matches" target="_blank"> molecular orbitals</a>
with energy of the photons of the incident light. Incident light that hits the chromophore can thus be absorbed by exciting an electron from its 
ground state into an excited state. So there is a range of wavelength,called the absorption band, where the light is absorbed. This absorption band
has a maxima at a particular wavelength λ<sub>max</sub>. As a result there comes an anomaly in the ORD curve at the neighborhood of the chromophore. The absolute magnitude of the optical rotation at first varies rapidly with wavelength, crosses zero at absorption maxima and then again varies rapidly with wavelength but in opposite direction. Such anomaly is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_effect" target="_blank">Cotton effect</a>. As opposed to plain curves, these curves exhibit a number of extreme peaks and troughs depending on the number of absorbing groups. The Cotton effect is called positive if the optical rotation first increases as the wavelength decreases (as first observed by Cotton), and negative if the rotation first decreases. The following figure exhibits both types of Cotton effects.

<br/>
<p>
<b>Octant Rule: an empirical method to determine type of Cotton effect in Ketones</b><br/>
In case of saturated alkyl ketones there is a way, known as octant rule,  to predict the sign of cotton effect (+ve or -ve) directly from the understanding of the structure. We can divide the space around the ketone into eight octants by looking down the carbonyl as shown below.<br/></p>

<p>Four octants in the front of the oxygen (toward the observer) and four behind. The front four can be ignored but the rear four usually contain all the atoms in the molecule. Each of these four rear octants are assigned a sign(+ ve or -ve) and all the atoms of the molecule are distributed in these four octants. Now depending on the occupancy of these four octants the sign of the cotton effect may be determined. The sign of the octant having highest occupancy determines the sign of the cotton effect.

<p></p><h2> Goal of The Experiment </h2><p></p>
<br/>
<p>
In this experiment user will observe CD and ORD spectrum of same samples. These samples are chiral molecules with chromophore. It is expected that by doing this experiment the user will develop an understanding of interrelations between ORD and CD spectra.

<strong>Follow the steps given below to successfully complete the experiment. </strong><br/>
 	</p>
 	
<ol>
<p></p><li>
In the “Understanding Structure of Chiral Molecules” step you will be given four samples. You can click on any sample and study its structure and conformation.
</li><p></p>
<p></p><li>
Once you are satisfied you can click "Next" to go to the next Step.
</li><p></p>
<p></p><li>
Next Step is "Assigning R &amp; S Configuration". Here you are given structures of four samples as individul Jmol applets. The Table "Jmol Instructions" provides guide lines to study those structures efficiently. You have to decide whether the structure is a R or a S enantiomer and select the corresponding Radio Button for each structure. Once you decide and choose your option for all the four structures you should submit your answer. You will be informed whether your decission is correct or not. You can skip this step at any point of time by clicking "Skip".  To decide whether the structure is R or S you may follow the following instructions
</li><p></p>
<br/>
 <ol>
 <p></p><li>
 First look at the atoms that are directly attached to the stereocenter of the compound.  A substituent that has a higher atomic number takes precedence over a substituent that has a lower atomic number.  Hydrogen is the lowest priority substituent.  When you are dealing with isotopes, the atom with the higher atomic mass received higher priority.
 </li><p></p>
 <p></p><li>
 <em>Note: </em> The lowest priority substituents should always go away from the viewer When you have two substituents that have equal rank, we proceed along the two respective  substituent chains until we find a point of difference.
 <br/>
<em> Note: </em>Keep in mind that priority is determined by the first point of difference along the two similar
 substituent chains. After you have reached the first point of difference, the rest of the chain is irrelevant.
 </li><p></p>
<p> </p><li>
 When you are looking for the first point of difference on similar substituent chains, you may encounter branching.  If there is branching, we choose the branch that is higher in priority. When the two substituents have similar branches, you rank the elements within the branches until you reach a point of difference.
 </li><p></p>
 <p></p><li>
 When you come across double and triple bonds, treat them as if they were the same number of single bonds connected to that atom instead.  Think of the atoms as duplicated or triplicated:
 </li><p></p>
<p> </p><li>
 After all your substituents have been prioritized in the correct manner, you can name it either R or S.  By putting the lowest priority substituent in the back (dashed line), the rotation of the other three substituents will help determine whether the molecule is R or S. In the order of priority (1, 2, 3), if the molecule rotates to the right, it is an R. Conversely, if it rotates to the left, it is considered a S.
 </li><p></p>
 </ol>
 <br/>
 
<p></p><li>
In next step you will be measuring the ORD spectrum of different chiral samples. First click the "Switch the ORD mode" button. The samples will be activated for selecting. Select any sample and "Measure ORD". The ORD spectrum will be shown on screen. You can “Measure Again” or skip the step.
</li> <p></p>
<p></p><li>
Next Step is the "Analysis" step. At the left side of your screen you are given a structure and you are provided with a prior knowledge that "R-spiroacytal has -ve ORD curves". Now you have to decide among the four given ORD spectra the given structure matches with which which one. Once you select one graph you should submit your result and you will informed whether you are right or wrong. If you do correctly you can load the next sample. You can skip this step also at any point of time by clicking "Skip". Otherwise you will be asked to perform the analysis for all four samples. 
</li><p></p> <br/><br/>
